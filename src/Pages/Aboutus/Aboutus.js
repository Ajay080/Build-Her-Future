In Node.js, you can check if two strings are equal using a simple comparison operator (===). The === operator compares both the value and the type of the operands. If both are the same, the operator returns true, indicating that the strings are equal. If they are different in either value or type, it returns false, indicating that the strings are not equal.

Here's how you can use the === operator to check if two strings are equal:
